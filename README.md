### what is it?

a simple card flip memory game, there's multiple levels with varying difficulty, combo streak counter, and sfx toggle. i've also included an input responsive alert border (deaf friendly design)(feel free to copy this to your own game).

the border is black by default, fitting a 16:9 ratio, it will blink red if the player incorrectly matches two cards and blink green if correct!

different modes/levels:
1. easy: limited moves
2. medium: cards flip back to hidden after 1 second if not matched
3. hard: cards shuffle every 5 seconds
4. challenge: limited moves (the number of moves is tracked and displayed, starting at 20) & a countdown timer (starting at 35 seconds)

- note: be sure to zoom out to about 75% ish when playing to view the border. this was done purposefully incase you'd prefer to play without it.
